"The player is presented with a game field containing a number of bricks. A "
"ball travels across the screen, bouncing off the top and side walls. When a "
"brick is hit, the ball bounces away and the brick is destroyed. The player "
"loses a life when the ball touches the bottom of the field. To prevent this "
"from happening, the player has to use a movable bar to bounce the ball "
"upward, situated at the bottom of the window. The purpose of the game is to "
"progress through the levels destroying all bricks present in each, and "
"trying to get a highscore."
