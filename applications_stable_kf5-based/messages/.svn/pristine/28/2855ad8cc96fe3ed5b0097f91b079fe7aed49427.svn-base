"KXStitch is a program that lets you create cross stitch patterns and charts. "
"Patterns can be created from scratch on a user defined size of grid, which "
"can be enlarged or reduced in size as your pattern progresses. Alternatively "
"you can import images from many graphics file formats which will allow you "
"to reduce the number of colors and to restrict the conversion to full "
"stitches or optionally use fractional stitches. You may also use images as "
"backgrounds allowing you to trace over them. These imported images can then "
"be modified using the supplied tools to produce your final design."
