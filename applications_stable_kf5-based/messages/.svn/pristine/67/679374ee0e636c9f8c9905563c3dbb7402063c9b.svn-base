"Kanagram is a game based on anagrams of words: the puzzle is solved when the "
"letters of the scrambled word are put back in the correct order. There is no "
"limit on either time taken, or the amount of attempts to solve the word. It "
"features several included word lists, a hints-and-cheats help system, a word "
"list editor, and allows for updating and distributing wordlists via "
"KNewStuff. The interface is scalable and appropriate for children."
