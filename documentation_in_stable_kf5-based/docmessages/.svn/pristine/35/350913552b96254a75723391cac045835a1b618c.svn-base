"developer wants to a edit a file, he has to <emphasis>lock</emphasis> it. "
"Only one developer at a time can a lock a file. When he has finished "
"editing, the lock is released. On the one hand, with this model, conflicts "
"can never happen. On the other hand, two developers can not work on the same "
"file at the same time, even when their changes do not affect each other. "
"This can be a bottleneck. We are not going to discuss the organisational "

"You should not use these features unless you are sure that your project "
