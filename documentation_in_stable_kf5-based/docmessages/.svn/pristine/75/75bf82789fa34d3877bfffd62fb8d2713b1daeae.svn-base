"Once you have written down all the things you need to say, consider the time "

"paper and a clock with a second hand. Practise your presentation over and "

"someone says you have ten minutes, never go over the allowed time. Secondly, "
"when you actually do it in front of a live audience, it will not be the "

"in your own head. You will find ways of saying things about the subject. If "
"you've heard yourself do this presentation several times, you will know what "
"you are going to say next and how you are going to say it."

"An example. I teach Railway staff how to respond to accidents. I wanted to "
"use a slide to discuss how you can move dangerous loads from a derailed or "
"damaged rail vehicle to a road vehicle after an accident. The slide I made "
"had a simple drawing of tank wagon, the kind used for carrying gases or "
"oils. On the side I wrote <quote>Lethal Chemical Company</quote> so that I "
"do not have to explain it. I wanted to make several important points. First, "
"you must get any overhead electric wires turned off before you do anything "
"if they are within a certain distance. I drew one of the supporting "
"structures and drew an arrow with the safety distance on it. Then I wanted "
"to say that you must not transfer the wagon's contents in darkness or "
"thunderstorms. I drew a moon and a lightning bolt above the vehicle. You "
"must get specialist advice, so I drew a sheet of paper and wrote the word "
"<quote>Plan</quote> near the vehicle. You also have to ensure that the "
"vehicle does not move when the weight inside is removed. I drew little red "
"wedges by the wheels. Everything I need to talk about is on this drawing. "
"All I have to do is look at the drawing and it tells me what I need to "
