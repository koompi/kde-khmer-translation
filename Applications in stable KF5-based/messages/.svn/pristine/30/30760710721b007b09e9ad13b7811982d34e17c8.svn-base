"Kig is an interactive mathematics software for learning and teaching "
"geometry. It allows to explore mathematical figures and concepts using the "
"computer and also can serve as a drawing tool for mathematical figures. "
"Constructions can be made with points, vectors, lines, and polygons and all "
"elements can be modified directly by using the mouse. Kig helps teachers and "
"students to make conjectures and to understand how to prove geometric "
"theorems."
