"SymbolEditor is a program that can create libraries of QPainterPath objects "
"with hints on how to render them. It was originally designed to create "
"symbol libraries for the KXStitch application, but other applications using "
"similar functionality could also make use of them. There are a number of "
"tools to aid the designing of symbols, including lines, bezier curves, "
"rectangle and ellipse. Text characters can be selected from any font and the "
"symbols can be mirrored or rotated. Symbols can be filled or unfilled, the "
"line end type and joining style can be changed and the line thickness can be "
"varied."
