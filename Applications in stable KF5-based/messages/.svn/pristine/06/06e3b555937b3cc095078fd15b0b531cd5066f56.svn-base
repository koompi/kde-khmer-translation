"Step is an interactive physical simulator. It allows you to explore the "
"physical world through simulations. It works like this: you place some "
"bodies on the scene, add some forces such as gravity or springs, then click "
"Simulate and Step shows you how your scene will evolve according to the laws "
"of physics. You can change every property of the bodies/forces in your "
"experiment (even during simulation) and see how this will change evolution "
"of the experiment. With Step you cannot only learn but feel how physics "
"works!"
