"Version 1.0 already offered a lot of functionality, but after the project "
"had been reviewed at Paul's University, other developers could join and they "

"Paul had to retire from the development team in Summer 2002 but, as Free and "
"Open Source Software, the program continues to improve and evolve and is "
"being maintained by a group of developers from different parts of the world. "
"In September 2002 the project changed its name from <application>&UML; "
"Modeller</application>, to &umbrello;. There are several reasons for the "
"change of names, the most important ones being that just <quote>uml</quote> "
"&mdash; as it was commonly known &mdash; was a much too generic name and "
"caused problems with some distributions. The other important reason is that "
"the developers think <application>Umbrello</application> is a much cooler "
"name."
